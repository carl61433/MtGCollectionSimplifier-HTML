# MtGCollectionSimplifier

Singular HTML page with javascript that takes an MtG set code, card collector's number, and whether or not it is foil,
then fetches the card name from Scryfall, and displays it in a text box in CSV format. This can then be downloaded
as a CSV file for importing into Moxfield's collection tracker.
